Four football players from Damascus High School in Damascus, Maryland, have been charged with first-degree rape after allegedly sexually assaulting younger teammates with broomsticks in a hazing incident last month.	1	0	0	crime
The accused players – all 15 years old – allegedly held down and assaulted four freshmen on the junior varsity football team – all 14 years old – before a practice on Halloween, Washington, D.C., news station WTOP reported.	1	0	0	crime
According to the police report, the upperclassmen turned off the lights in the locker room and attacked the younger boys by pulling down their pants and assaulting or attempting to assault them with the broomsticks.	1	0	0	crime

We're standing in Lab Room 1 of Tamminen's sleep lab, a sparsely decorated room with a bed, a colourful rug, and framed paper butterflies.	0	0	0	science-technology
Above the bed is a small electroencephalography (EEG) machine and monitor to detect activity in each research participant's brain, via electrodes placed on the head.	0	0	0	science-technology
These measure not only activity in different regions of the brain (frontal, temporal, and parietal), depending on their placement on the head, but also muscle tone (through an electrode on the chin) and eye movement (through an electrode next to each eye).	0	0	0	science-technology

SWS is important for forming and retaining memories, whether of vocabulary, grammar, or other knowledge.	0	0	0	science-technology
The interaction of different parts of the brain is key here.	0	0	0	science-technology
During SWS, the hippocampus, which is good at quick learning, is in constant communication with the neocortex, to consolidate it for long term recall.	0	1	0	science-technology
This information expressway between the hippocampus and the neocortex is populated by sleep spindles – spikes in brain activity that are no more than three seconds long.	0	0	0	science-technology
"Sleep spindles are somehow associated with linking new information with existing information," Tamminen says.	0	0	0	science-technology

While Tamminen focuses on slow-wave sleep, there's a theory that REM sleep plays a role in language development too, through the dreaming that happens during this part of the sleep cycle.	0	0	0	science-technology
Research at the sleep and dreams lab at Canada's University of Ottawa found that the brains of undergraduates dreaming in French were essentially able to make new connections with the language they were learning.	0	1	1	science-technology
Research has suggested that the regions of the brain that manage logic (the frontal lobe) and emotion (the amygdala) interact differently during dreams, allowing for these imaginative new connections in the language learner.	0	1	1	science-technology
This gave them more time to integrate what they were learning while they slept – and better results during the day.	0	1	1	science-technology

Monitoring what happens in children's brains during sleep, and how much information they retain before and after sleep, shows that sleep helps with accessing implicit knowledge (procedural memory) and making it explicit (declarative memory).	0	1	1	science-technology

"Daytime naps in young children have been shown to be really important for vocabulary growth, generalisation of the meaning of words and abstraction in language learning," she says.	0	1	1	science-technology
"Sleep continues to be important for memory and learning throughout the lifetime, though."	0	1	0	science-technology
Not only does sleep help with accessing this information, it also changes the way this information is accessed.	0	1	1	science-technology
This makes brains more flexible at retrieving information (or able to access it in more ways).	0	1	1	science-technology
