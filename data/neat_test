Tony Hughes has been a long-haul truck driver for more than 20 years.	0	0	0	economy-job-market
"'Rosebud' is on," he said, flipping a switch.	0	0	0	economy-job-market
Today, he's hauling 20,000 pounds of freight down the Florida turnpike in a self-driving, robotic truck.	0	0	0	economy-job-market
It's been retrofitted with a self-driving kit made by Starsky Robotics.	0	0	0	economy-job-market
Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, who founded the company in 2016 with Kartik Tiwari, said, "We think that sometime towards the end of the year, we could be doing this run without a person behind the wheel."	0	1	0	economy-job-market
And if it's not his company, it might be Otto, whose truck made headlines last October by driving itself across Colorado to deliver a shipment of beer.	0	0	0	economy-job-market
Otto is owned by Uber, which also has been testing self-driving taxis in Pennsylvania and Arizona.	0	0	0	economy-job-market
But here's the thing!	1	0	0	economy-job-market
Once our trucks and taxis drive themselves, what will happen to the people who used to do those jobs?	1	0	0	economy-job-market
In the U.S., that's 180,000 taxi drivers, 600,000 Uber drivers, and 3.5 million truck drivers.	0	0	0	economy-job-market
Ford says driverless cars and trucks are just the beginning of a wave of automation that will threaten millions of jobs, in every industry at once, like America's nearly five million store workers.	1	0	0	economy-job-market
In Seattle, Amazon is testing the Amazon Go grocery.	0	0	0	economy-job-market
The company says shoppers there will soon be able to walk into the store, take what they want, and walk out again, without ever encountering an employee.	0	1	1	economy-job-market
Sensors will detect what you take and bill you automatically.	0	0	0	economy-job-market
"The cashiers are totally gone," Ford said.	1	0	0	economy-job-market
You scale that out, and that's just extraordinarily disruptive."	1	0	0	economy-job-market
At Zume Pizza in Silicon Valley, four specialized robots help make the pizza.	0	0	0	economy-job-market
Eventually, the company plans to replace the remaining humans on the line, too.	0	1	0	economy-job-market
Pogue said, "You would think there would be some Roman pizza chefs who'd say, 'No, this is not the way it's been done since our ancestors!'"	1	0	0	economy-job-market
The common wisdom is that robots primarily threaten repetitive, blue-collar jobs.	1	0	0	economy-job-market
Not so, says Martin Ford: "We're seeing dramatic advances in the area of computers analyzing tumors, recognizing medical scans, mammograms, and being able to find disease.	1	1	1	economy-job-market
We're seeing algorithms move into areas like journalism, for example."	0	1	0	economy-job-market
"Oh, yeah.	0	0	0	economy-job-market
Absolutely," Ford said.	0	0	0	economy-job-market
Algorithms are even threatening the Masters of the Universe.	1	0	0	economy-job-market
Earlier this year, Black Rock, the world's largest money manager, announced that it's laying off dozens of human stock pickers and replacing them with robots.	1	0	0	economy-job-market

"And now they're going click, click, click.	0	0	0	economy-job-market

A quarter of the people on the famous Goldman Sachs trading floor aren't traders; they're coders, writing software to automate the routine grunt work of employees all across the company.	0	0	0	economy-job-market
Pogue asked, "Someday, could software replace the functions of these folks?"	0	0	0	economy-job-market
All right, we get it; no job is safe.	1	0	0	economy-job-market
According to a recent study, 47 percent of American jobs could be lost to automation in the next 20 years.	1	0	0	economy-job-market
Ford says it's time to start thinking about what we're going to live on, in the post-robot economy.	1	0	0	economy-job-market
Pogue asked.	0	0	0	economy-job-market
"Right.	0	0	0	economy-job-market
It's also meaning and purpose, and a place to go every day."	0	0	0	economy-job-market
"That's right.	0	0	0	economy-job-market
That's going to be a real challenge, but I think it's a challenge we can solve," said Ford.	1	1	0	economy-job-market
Most experts do agree that automation will soon take over millions of our jobs.	1	0	0	economy-job-market
But they don't all agree that that will mean mass unemployment, including MIT economist David Autor.	1	0	0	economy-job-market
We don't dig ditches by hand anymore.	0	1	0	economy-job-market
"Except that these young people might think, 'Well, maybe I'll go into retail,' but that's also going away," said Pogue.	1	0	0	economy-job-market
"'Well, maybe I'll be a chef,' but that's always going away.	1	0	0	economy-job-market
Autor replied, "So let's do the following thought exercise: It's the year 1900, and 40% of all employment is in agriculture, right?	0	0	0	economy-job-market
And so some twerpy economist from MIT teleports back in time to Farmer Pogue here, and says, 'A hundred years from now, only 2% of people will be working in agriculture.'	1	0	0	economy-job-market
What do you think the other 38% of people are going to do?	0	0	0	economy-job-market
You wouldn't say, 'Oh, search engine optimization.	0	0	0	economy-job-market
Health and wellness, software and mobile devices.'	0	0	0	economy-job-market
And sure enough.	0	0	0	economy-job-market
despite having replaced so many stock traders with software, Elisha Wiesel says that Goldman Sachs still employs the same number of people -- and that their jobs have been enhanced by automation.	1	1	1	economy-job-market
"And all of a sudden, that young person is engaging with the client on their actual problems, rather than being stuck till 1:00 a.m. doing nothing but manning several different spreadsheets and trying to corral all this data together," said Wiesel.	0	1	0	economy-job-market
You'll hear the same argument at Starsky Robotics.	0	0	0	economy-job-market
Its trucks will self-drive only on the highways.	0	0	0	economy-job-market
And if Tony Hughes can keep his job without the weeks away, "in that aspect," he said, "it's going to make my life better."	0	1	1	economy-job-market
If he gets hired to be one of the remote-control pilots, right?	0	0	0	economy-job-market
So, since this might be Pogue's last chance to be in a truck with a human driver, he asked Hughes to blow the horn.	1	0	0	economy-job-market

Americans who stand against Donald Trump's political corruption have taken to opposing anything with his name on it.	1	0	0	politics
And in what may be one of the biggest conflicts of interest between a politician and the media of all time, Trump is still Executive Producer of the NBC show Celebrity Apprentice which now stars Arnold Schwarzenegger.	1	0	0	politics
The new season debuted on Monday night, and in a symbolically fitting bit of karma, corporate malfeasance blocked scores of Americans from being able to watch it on television.	1	0	0	politics
DirecTV dropped local network affiliates across the nation from its roster, in an attempt to force those affiliates into a more favorable deal.	1	1	0	politics
If the Democratic Party had its way in Congress, that kind of corporate malfeasance would be outlawed for the benefit of the consumer.	1	1	0	politics
But Donald Trump's Republican Party would never allow mega-corporations to be reined in, and so DirecTV gets away with what it wants.	1	0	0	politics
And according to the explosively negative reaction across social media, it appears thousands of angry people were blocked from being able to watch the season premiere of Trump's television show.	1	0	0	politics
"WTF @nbc I can't watch Celebrity Apprentice with @DIRECTV" exclaimed one angry Twitter user.	1	0	0	politics
"How am I supposed to watch the Apprentice with @DIRECTV and @kcranews killing my vibe," tweeted another.	1	0	0	politics
The full feed of people tweeting about "DirecTV" and "Apprentice" pointed to just how many people were cut off from watching the show.	1	0	0	politics
In other words, considering his apparent financial participation in the show, it was a bad night for Arnold Schwarzenegger and Donald Trump.	1	0	0	politics
And for the record, Schwarzenegger's new "You're Terminated" catch phrase was predictably dumb.	1	0	0	politics

AMSTERDAM – It's not a problem many vacation destinations spend much effort worrying about or money trying to fix: the wrong kind of tourist.	1	0	0	travel
But that is the challenge increasingly faced by Amsterdam, where visitor numbers have shot up more than 60 percent in the past decade, bolstered by low-cost flights, cheap accommodation and the ease of traveling across open European borders.	1	1	1	travel
With its centuries-old canals, vibrant historic center and flourishing art scene, Amsterdam takes pride in its cultural riches.	0	0	1	travel
But there is a growing perception that some who come to the city are more interested in less high-minded pursuits – namely, marijuana and prostitution, both of which are largely legal – and may be doing more harm than good.	1	0	0	travel
Other destinations have struggled under the sheer weight of visitors: the Galápagos Islands; Dubrovnik, Croatia; and Venice have all expressed concern about "overtourism," with technology, including apps like Airbnb, often cited as a driver of the problem.	1	0	0	travel
But in Amsterdam, it's not just the number of tourists that pose a problem.	1	0	0	travel
It's how they behave.	0	0	0	travel
Officials are trying to address the issue.	1	0	0	travel
Femke Halsema, the new mayor, visited the red-light district in the De Wallen section of the city in July, the month after she took office.	0	0	0	travel
Soon after, her administration announced a set of measures intended to curb misconduct.	1	1	0	travel
They include on-the-spot collection of fines as high as 140 euros, or about $165, for public urination, drunkenness or excessive noise (enforcement agents will be equipped with hand-held devices to take card payments); rigorous street cleaning; and the hiring of additional "hosts," or security workers in orange T-shirts, who are trained to give information and remind people of the rules, which include no drinking in the streets and no photographing prostitutes.	1	1	0	travel
Perhaps most important, the city is also betting on a marketing campaign to persuade visitors to respect the city and its rules.	0	1	0	travel

Pim van Burk, 33, a corporate headhunter who lives above one of the brothels in the area, said that the noise did not bother him but that the crowds could make it difficult to get home.	1	0	0	travel
He said he had tried to solve the problem by installing a second bell on his bike.	1	1	0	travel
"That way, people think it's more than one bike behind them," he explained.	0	0	0	travel
The gentrification project, which concluded this year, included closing more than 100 brothels and dozens of coffee shops (where cannabis can be bought), and trying to bring different kinds of businesses to the area.	0	1	0	travel
Critics say that the 1012 plan has had unwanted side effects: By shrinking the red-light district, the city has effectively given the area over to characterless shops selling tacky souvenirs or refreshments.	1	0	0	travel
Several measures to improve the experience of visiting Amsterdam were put in place starting in 2016, when the city first recognized that the tourist avalanche had downsides.	1	1	0	travel
Riding the unwieldy, multiple-person beer bikes (a kind of pub on wheels) into the city center was prohibited, and a deal was struck with Airbnb to collect tourism taxes.	1	1	0	travel
The authorities also tried to limit the number of tourist buses parked in the center of the city.	1	1	0	travel
But the latest efforts go further.	0	0	0	travel
Those groups tend to visit the city to party, and they are a big part of the crowds on Friday and Saturday nights.	0	0	0	travel
Likewise, they promise to hit the pockets of those engaging in obnoxious behavior, such as public urination and littering.	1	1	0	travel
"We don't want to wag our finger at them, knowing this will be countereffective," said Camiel Verhey, who is in charge of the campaign at the ad agency WaveMaker.	1	0	0	travel
"We just want to show them how to enjoy the freedom on offer."	0	0	0	travel
Most of the ads have been placed online, focusing on sites where would-be visitors book flights, look for accommodation or check the weather.	0	0	0	travel
The campaign also uses Facebook and Instagram ads.	0	0	0	travel
The city is also supporting a more low-tech approach, called "I live here," a movement organized by residents who meet with tourists, run poster campaigns and generally try to raise awareness that not everyone who comes to De Wallen is there to drink and party.	1	1	0	travel
"Sometime it is as simple as tourists not realizing that real people live here," said Edwin Schölvinck, an organizer of the group and longtime resident of De Wallen.	1	0	0	travel
And while he acknowledged that some of the tourists needed to behave better, he said he did not want them to go away completely.	1	1	0	travel
"I like tourists, I like people coming here to have fun," he said.	0	0	0	travel
'Well, maybe I'll be a paralegal,' but that's also going away."	1	0	0	economy-job-market

The Trump administration relied on a misleadingly edited video from a contributor to the conspiracy site Infowars to help justify removing the credentials of CNN's chief White House correspondent, a striking escalation in President Trump's broadsides against the press.	1	0	0	politics
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, falsely accused Jim Acosta, the CNN journalist, of "placing his hands on a young woman," a White House intern, as Mr. Acosta asked questions that irked the president during a formal news conference on Wednesday.	1	0	0	politics
Television footage showed that Mr. Acosta and the intern made brief, benign contact – "Pardon me, ma'am," the correspondent said – as she tried to take a microphone away from him at Mr. Trump's behest.	0	0	0	politics
But Ms. Sanders posted a 15-second video clip on Twitter that misleadingly suggested Mr. Acosta had pushed the intern's upper arm.	1	0	0	politics
The clip was identical to one posted earlier by Paul Joseph Watson, an Infowars contributor, according to a forensic analysis by The New York Times.	0	0	0	politics
"We will not tolerate the inappropriate behavior clearly documented in this video," Ms. Sanders wrote.	1	0	0	politics
Infowars, which has been banned by platforms like Twitter and Facebook, is known for spreading conspiracy theories, including one pushed by its founder, Alex Jones, that the mass shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., was a hoax.	1	0	0	politics
Ms. Sanders – who once encouraged Americans to view the work of James O'Keefe, a right-wing activist, "whether it's accurate or not" – declined to say on Thursday why she had distributed the video from her official White House account.	1	0	0	politics
"The question is: Did the reporter make contact or not?" Ms. Sanders said in a statement.	0	0	0	politics
But the editing, including zooming in and repeating several frames, exaggerated the contact between Mr. Acosta and the intern.	1	0	0	politics
The low quality of the video, which briefly freezes either deliberately or because of a glitch, adds to the ambiguity, the analysis showed.	1	0	0	politics
The removal of Mr. Acosta's credentials, which curbs his access to the West Wing and its staff, has little precedent in the modern White House.	1	0	0	politics
Past presidents have clashed with outspoken journalists like Sam Donaldson and Helen Thomas, but did not restrict their access.	1	0	0	politics
Still, the move against Mr. Acosta, a frequent antagonist known for challenging the president during news conferences, was not entirely a surprise.	1	0	0	politics
As a candidate in 2016, Mr. Trump barred journalists from Univision, The Washington Post, BuzzFeed News and Politico from attending his rallies.	1	0	0	politics
As president, he has popularized the phrases "enemy of the people" and "fake news" and threatened to pull broadcast licenses and change libel laws to make it easier to sue.	1	0	0	politics
The daily White House press briefing has slowly vanished.	1	0	0	politics
In July, a CNN reporter was barred from a Rose Garden event because White House aides said she had asked questions too aggressively.	1	0	0	politics
Mr. Trump and his political team are no doubt aware that Mr. Acosta is a useful foil.	0	0	0	politics
"CNN sucks!" is a common chant at the president's rallies, and there is little political downside for the administration to restrict access to one of the network's star correspondents.	1	0	0	politics
And, as with most things Trump, nothing was cut-and-dried.	1	0	0	politics
There was the timing: Mr. Acosta's credential was stripped hours after the president fired his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and had to explain away a difficult midterm election that handed his Democratic antagonists control of the House.	1	0	0	politics
Political strategists observed that a controversy over press rights, instigated by the White House, would make for a useful ploy to distract journalists and perhaps the public.	1	1	0	politics
Then there were the players: a showman president and an ambitious television correspondent in the spotlight.	0	0	0	politics
Mr. Acosta sometimes elicits eye-rolls from others in the White House press corps, who wonder if his aggressive questions are meant less to draw out information from Mr. Trump than to create a camera-ready spectacle.	1	0	0	politics
"Most of the people there were serious reporters asking serious questions," Chris Wallace, the "Fox News Sunday" moderator, said of Wednesday's news conference.	0	0	0	politics
"But Jim Acosta, I thought, embarrassed himself."	1	0	0	politics
Dozens of other journalists disagreed with that view, offering public support.	1	1	0	politics
The Washington Post's media columnist Margaret Sullivan, for one, advised CNN to sue the White House on First Amendment grounds.	1	0	0	politics
The move against Mr. Acosta also came shortly after a pipe bomb turned up at CNN's New York headquarters.	1	0	0	politics
At Infowars, the imprimatur of the White House was a welcome development.	0	1	1	politics

Mr. Watson, who rose to prominence on the site, has kept his social media and YouTube accounts, providing one of the few remaining means for Mr. Jones to reach a mainstream audience.	0	1	1	politics
The video tweeted by Ms. Sanders makes it appear that Mr. Acosta is making forceful, sustained contact with the intern's arm.	1	0	0	politics
The Infowars video also has no sound, so that Mr. Acosta's "pardon me" is not heard.	1	0	0	politics
The news conference was broadcast on major cable outlets, including the public affairs network C-SPAN, meaning that she had other options than to use a clip put together by a contributor to a notorious site.	1	0	0	politics
Mr. Watson, who is based in Britain, did not respond to requests for comment.	0	0	0	politics
In a video interview posted on Infowars on Thursday, Mr. Watson acknowledged to Mr. Jones that the clip had what he called "digital artifact problems."	1	0	0	politics
"I ran it through like three different programs and re-uploaded it to Twitter, O.K.?" Mr. Watson said.	0	0	0	politics

Mr. Trump has made CNN into one of his marquee targets.	1	0	0	politics
In the summer of 2017, he used the @realdonaldtrump and @POTUS accounts to share a 28-second video that showed Mr. Trump himself violently wrestling to the ground an opponent with the CNN logo for a head.	1	0	0	politics
"#FraudNewsNetwork," the president added as a comment.	1	0	0	politics
CNN's president, Jeff Zucker, has recently criticized Mr. Trump in unflinching language, calling his anti-press language a danger to journalists.	1	0	0	politics
On Wednesday, the network said the White House's retaliation against Mr. Acosta was a "threat to our democracy."	1	0	0	politics
"If you look at original, higher-quality videos from other vantage points, you can more clearly see that while there was some contact between the reporter and intern, he did not strike her as his hand comes down," said Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at Dartmouth College who analyzed the clip for The Times.	0	1	0	politics
"That's not doctoring.	0	0	0	politics
"The video is clear, he did."	0	0	0	politics
There is no evidence the video has been faked.	0	0	0	politics
Infowars seized on the publicity that went with Ms. Sanders's use of the clip, posting incendiary items under headlines like "Did Jim Acosta Assault a Woman?" 	1	0	0	politics
Mr. Jones did not respond to a message left on his cellphone.	0	0	0	politics
Sarah Sanders was perfectly correct in posting this video, which is genuine, and it proves her point that Acosta placed his hands on the woman to overpower her."	1	1	1	politics
"You're right, Paul, he overpowered a woman," Mr. Jones interjected.	1	0	0	politics
The move is likely to rile Mr. Trump's opponents, buoy his supporters and have little or no effect on those occupying the nation's shrinking middle ground.	1	1	0	politics
